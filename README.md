# Property Evaluation and Loan Estimation

**Keywords** - Machine Learning, Python, scikit-learn, Tkinter

### Quick Project Description -
  - Developed a software designed to centralise and introduce transparency in the process of evaluation of property for customers, property dealers and government.
  - Applied machine learning to evaluate a property based on features like area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and locality, and further, based on the evaluation of the property, estimated the amount of loan that can be sanctioned based on the credit score of the owner.


### Project Repo Navigation
  - `regressionModelTraining.py`, in the `Code` folder, implements the machine learning pipeline to pre-process the raw data and train the machine learning models
  - `Data` folder contains raw as well as the cleaned/processed dataset
